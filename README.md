## Dependencies
You can use either `npm` or  `yarn` to install dependencies. 
You can install the dependencies individually below üëá:

Hardhat
```zsh
yarn add hardhat
```

Dotenv
```zsh
yarn add dotenv
```

Ethers.js
```zsh
yarn add @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers@^5.0.0
```
OpenZeppelin

Hardhat-etherscan (to verify your contract)
```
yarn add @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan
```

or just run ü§ì

```zsh
yarn install
```

## Steps to Deploy
1. Make a copy of `example.env` and fill it out
    ```
    cp example.env .env
    ```
    You should fill out at least the following fields: `RINKEBY_URL`, `RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY`.

    - To get your `RINKEBY_URL`
        Go to [Alchemy](https://www.alchemyapi.io/), sign up, create a new App in its dashboard and select the network as Rinkeby, and add the url to your `.env` file.

    - To export your private key from Metamask, 
        Open Metamask and
        Go to Account Details > Export Private Key,
        Be aware of NEVER putting real Ether into testing accounts.
        Add this private key to your `.env` file as `RINKEBY_PRIVATE_KEY`.

2. Make any modifications to the smart contract in `./contract` and deploy script in `./scripts/deploy.js`

3. Compile the contract
    ```
    npx hardhat compile
    ```
4. Edit the deploy script.

    Modify `scripts/deploy.js` to include the specific deploy arguments that you want your ERC721 contract to be deployed with.
    In this case, the name, symbol and merkle root.
    
5. Deploy the contract
    ```
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
    ```

You should see a confirmation in your terminal like this:
```zsh
Compiling 1 file with 0.8.4
Compilation finished successfully
Contract deployed to address: 0x...
```
